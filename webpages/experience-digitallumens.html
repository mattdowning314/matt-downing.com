		<td>Challenge: Keep it very low power so that can be powered by a battery for a very long time (1-2 years), increase sensor reliability and improve form factor, Switch to a different sensor method (from PIR to thermopile) after having issues with PIR technology for presence detection</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Success: Initial prototype proved that it would work well at being low power and that it could be created with a relatively small form factor, next prototype had better PCB layout and allowed for a more logical and presentable size and shape, switched sensor and initial testing proved sensor would work so another PCB prototype was designed</td>
