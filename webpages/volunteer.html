		  	<p> I have been a member of the Roxbury Robotics organization for the past four years since freshmen year of college at Northeastern University. The club is focused on developing STEM skills and interest in the community of Roxbury through the learning of how to build and code robots. The Lego Mindstorms framework is used for this development. Since January 2021, I have been the Treasurer and in charge of updating the website. I have learned to work with a wide range of people in the university administration as well as improved my skills in WordPress.
