		<td>Challenge: Learn new PCB design tool (Circuit Maker). Learn firmware programming tool (STM32CubeIDE). Developing most of the system from the beginning. Sourcing components for the entire system that work in a small form factor. Condensing design down to fit on a tight size constraint of PCB.</td>

		<td>Success: Developed five prototype PCBs each incorporating new features and fixing hardware bugs. Got the system from concept to proof of concept and turned over project to full time engineer for full product development. Created initial firmware to test and prove out CAN communication as well as other peripherals. Transferred knowledge to full time firmware engineer to develop product.</td>
